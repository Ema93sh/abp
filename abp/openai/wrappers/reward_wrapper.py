    Adds support for reward decomposition of the environment.
    To support reward decompisition the environment has to return reward as a list of dictionary values
    Example:
    [
        {
          "id": "unique ID of the type",
          "value": integer value indicating the reward got for this type,
          "description": description of the type (Can be used for explanation)
        }
    ]

    By default returns decomposed reward. It can be turned off by setting decompose_reward = False
